<h2>A deeper introduction in Unix dc</h2>

<h3>The program</h3>
<p>
Unix dc is one of the oldest interpreter programs which is still available on most of the Linux distros without installing it. The program goes back to the PDP-11 era. The programming of it must be easier than any serious assembler or other kind of interpreters like BASIC, because it was sometimes earlier available [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_(computer_program)" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html" target="_blank">2</a>]. It moves the difficulty to code to the programmer.
</p>
<p>
DC stands for <b>d</b>esk <b>c</b>alculator and can be programmed in reverse-polish notation. It's a stack oriented and supports arbitrary-precision. It supports registers, conditional statements and loops. These things are realised with macros saved in registers. Registers can only be single characters. It's really weird to program it.
</p>
Dc can be started with the command <b>dc</b> on your terminal. There will be no welcome text, just a plain command line for you to get things done right now! You can try these code snippets online with the <a href="https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=buildroot-x86.cfg" target="_blank">JS Linux</a> from bellard.org.

<h3>1. Variables</h3>
You can copy and paste the text or execute it from a file with <b>dc -f file.dc</b>.


<pre>
# This is a comment.
# <b>l</b> for load <b>s</b> for save
1 sa
2 sb
3 sc

la lb + lc * p sd
</pre>

Will print 9 and keeps it on the stack until it's saved to register <b>d</b>.


<h3>2. A conditional statement</h3>

<pre>
# function f, prints chars and deletes the stack
[ [a is bigger then 10] p c] sf

# executes function f if a is bigger than 10

# nothing happens
8 sa
[la 10 &lt;f] x

# function is called
11 sa
[la 10 &lt;f] x
</pre>


<h3>3. A for loop</h3>
<pre>
# prints number 0 to 10
# <b>d</b> is duplicate, <b>x</b> execute
0 sa
[la p 1 + d sa 10 !&lt;f] sf
lf x

# a faster way without a variable
[p 1 + d 10 !&lt;f] sf
0 lf x
</pre>

<h3>4. A loop in an inner loop</h3>
<pre>
# <b>xQ</b> leaves macros to level <b>x</b>. 
# It's a termination condition for the recursive function. 
# The <b>[A] p</b> is never executed. 
# The <b>st</b> only removes the last variable from the stack. 

[p 1 + d 3 !&lt;f st 4Q [A] p] sf

[1 + d d sa 0 lf x 3 !&lt;g] sg

0
lg x
</pre>

Edit: A even better, simpler solution:

<pre>
[p 1 + d 3 !&lt;f Q] sf

[1 + d d sa 0 lf x 3 !&lt;g] sg

0
lg x
</pre>



<h3>4. A multiplication table</h3>
It's your turn now, you only have to modify the code above!


<h3>5. Mandelbrot set</h3>
<p>
File: <a href="https://github.com/ben165/unix_dc/blob/master/mandelbrot.dc">mandelbrot.dc</a>
</p>
<p>
This code is far away from beeing good. I'm happy it worked out at the end. I literally sacrificed some brain parts writing this. 
</p>
<p>
Anyways, it creates an ASCII pattern which can be saved as a portable bitmap (PPM). With the conditions of 600x400 (row 6,7), a precision of 20 (row 2) and an iteration amount of 25 (row 28) you get following output.
</p>
<pre>
dc -f mandelbrot.dc > mandelbrot.ppm
</pre>
